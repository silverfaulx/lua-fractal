# lua-fractal
my pet fractal renderer

very unfinished and probably really unoptimized but i mean it sorta works so yeah

runs on luvit (because i was making lua discord bots) but i don't see why it wouldn't work with luajit if you fix the require stuff

requires a few things:
- https://github.com/ColonelThirtyTwo/LuaJIT-GLFW for opengl (this is rad and the only way i've been able to use opengl)
- https://github.com/Playermet/luajit-gmp for arbitrary precision stuff i don't really use yet but plan to
- lodepng dll if you want to texture it
- i don't really like downloading 13948710932478134 dependancies because nothing ever seems to work, so ill try to keep this low idk
